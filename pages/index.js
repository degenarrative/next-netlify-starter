              While working for George Lucas at Lucasfilm, Jacob collaborated with directors, artists, engineers, and his team to develop and support Georgeâ€™s vision for a toolset and pipeline to create high-quality digital pre-visualization sequences that was as easy and intuitive as film making in the real world. Since then, his singular focus has been to integrate cutting-edge technology into the creative process to push the boundaries of storytelling.

            The year is 2078. Technology is ubiquitous; shaping every aspect of life in ways once thought impossible. The galaxy itself burns with the light of progress, but restlessness lurks in the shadows. The great leap forward came a price. Corporate power grew to levels beyond reason - a blackened edge at the corners of existence.

            Against this dystopian backdrop, a rebellion has emerged. Neo-Elite Radical Degens, a faction of rogue tech-savants, aka "NERDs," operates in the shadows and wields a new breed of weapons: hardware-hacking guns, capable of manipulating the very tech that fuels their oppressors. Guided by the enigmatic figure known only as "The Hacker," the Nerds are a formidable force, striving to free the downtrodden from the yoke of corporate tyranny.
            </p>
            <p>
            The Corporations, unwilling to surrender their control of power, have mustered their own army of cybernetically enhanced soldiers and space-faring vessels. Their mission, to hunt down all Nerds and extinguish their revolution with a ruthless determination.

            The ingenuity of the NERDs has allowed them to build their own fleet of derelict ships. Salvaged from the scrap yards of the galaxy, and reworked with their own proprietary tech, these vessels are their mobile strongholds from which they launch daring raids against the corporations and their minions.

            This is the NERD War; a struggle for the soul of humanity, fought with electrons in the neon-lit alleyways of cyberspace. Fire and code, blood and the pulse of binary. The streets of the future boil over as the NERDs and Corporations clash in a conflict that will define their generation.
